    Retrieves the top 15 most relevant products (based on Euclidean distance)

    Steps:
      1. Reads the similarity analysis CSV (contains euclidean_distance for each product).
      2. Sorts products by distance in descending order (most similar first).
      3. Picks the top 15 products.
      4. Uses row_id to match these top products with the full main dataset.
      5. Preserves the ranking order from the similarity analysis.
      6. Saves the matched full product info to a new CSV file.
